### Inventools helps to covert yield value to Json or csv output


## Example to user yeild value to csv

```
from inventools import tools

Name_of_file = "language"

header_in_list=['s_no','language','version']

output_in_list = ["1","python","0.1"]

@tools.write_csv(Name_of_file,header_in_list)
def foo():
    yield(output_in_list)
foo()
```
#### output location in relative path 

└───output_csv
        language.csv


## Example to user yeild value to json

```
from inventools import tools

Name_of_file = "language"

header_in_list=['s_no','language','version']

output_in_list = ["1","python","0.1"]

@tools.write_json(Name_of_file,header_in_list)
def foo():
    yield(output_in_list)
foo()
```

#### output location in relative path 
└───output_json
        language.json


#####  Iteratable example 


```
from inventools import tools

Name_of_file = "language"

header_in_list=['s_no','language','version']

iteratable_object_in_list = [[1,"python",0.1],[2,"java",11],[3,"kotlin",2],[4,"golang",2]]

@tools.write_csv(Name_of_file,header_in_list)
def foo():
    for output_in_list in iteratable_object_in_list:
        yield(output_in_list)
foo()
```
